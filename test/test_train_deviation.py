"""
Test suite to provoke and verify train path deviation errors and edge cases.

This module contains tests designed to:
1. Provoke the "Train deviated from planned path!" error message
2. Test simultaneous train arrivals at switches
3. Test scenarios with direct neighbor switches
4. Verify robustness of train tracking and action planning

Run with: python -m pytest test/test_train_deviation.py -v
