Test suite to verify consistency between rail graph transitions and actual train movements.

This module contains comprehensive tests to check for discrepancies between the rail 
transition graph representation and the actual position of trains using Flatland's 
`rail_env.rail.check_action_on_agent` function as ground truth.

Run with: python -m pytest test/test_transition.py -v
